This is one of multiple CCMA exam simulation quiz questions can you answer the questions yourself in

00:17.740 --> 00:25.960
these quiz questions I'm using Cecka packet tracer to help you practically test and verify your knowledge

00:25.960 --> 00:31.160
of Cisco CCN a topic's in these questions.

00:31.160 --> 00:35.870
We are testing your knowledge of the life of a packet.

00:35.930 --> 00:40.130
Do you understand destination and source MAC addresses.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.410
Do you understand where those are used.

00:43.430 --> 00:51.620
Do you understand how traffic flows through a network and the various encapsulations used in a network.

00:51.620 --> 00:58.140
In this scenario I have two PCs PC one on the left and PC two on the right.

00:58.140 --> 01:01.820
They are connected to 36 50 switches.

01:01.820 --> 01:05.230
The switches are configured as a two switches.

01:05.270 --> 01:10.820
They are also two Cisco Isaw routers connected via a serial link.

01:10.830 --> 01:14.570
The scenario is PC one Ping's PC two.

01:14.720 --> 01:21.350
You need to answer the following questions based on the echo request a message sent from PC one to PC

01:21.350 --> 01:22.380
to.

01:22.430 --> 01:30.710
So look to the echo request a message not other traffic types an answer these questions What does the

01:30.710 --> 01:35.630
destination MAC address off of the frame at point A in the network.

01:35.630 --> 01:39.590
In other words what is the destination MAC address of the echo request.

01:39.590 --> 01:42.190
Message at this point.

01:42.290 --> 01:47.300
What is the actual destination MAC address.

01:47.300 --> 01:54.390
So in other words you need to determine what are the actual MAC addresses by looking at the frame and

01:54.390 --> 01:59.220
determining to which device is that MAC address belongs.

01:59.220 --> 02:06.350
Now to help you with the task in Peckham trace a use of the simulation mode simulation mode in packet

02:06.360 --> 02:14.460
tracer allows you to simulate the flow of traffic through a network and view what happens once you open

02:14.460 --> 02:20.560
up simulation mode on PC 1 generate traffic.

02:20.670 --> 02:28.150
So send a ping to the IP address of PC to which is 10 1 3 2

02:31.680 --> 02:34.920
and have a look at how the traffic flows.

02:35.400 --> 02:45.790
As we can see here an op packet has been created and the PCs are paying for the MAC address of the router.

02:45.810 --> 02:55.890
If you don't want to see other traffic talks you can edit your filters to only look at up and ICMP traffic

02:56.430 --> 02:57.660
with Empacher tracer

03:01.190 --> 03:06.810
So what will do is reset to that simulation and send you the packet again

03:10.830 --> 03:18.810
so we can see the OP a request to the router and the reply and then we can see the ICMP message.

03:18.810 --> 03:29.350
And if you click on the message you'll be able to view the inbound PDU and outbound PDU and then answer

03:29.390 --> 03:32.390
the questions.

03:32.410 --> 03:43.610
So by using simulation mode or by simply looking at the configurations of the devices in the topology

03:45.080 --> 03:47.500
you should be able to answer these questions.

03:48.580 --> 03:55.960
So they are various questions asking about MAC addresses and encapsulations used at different stages

03:55.990 --> 03:57.570
in the life of the packet

04:00.900 --> 04:04.450
for both echo request and Echo reply.

04:05.490 --> 04:08.250
Do you know how packets are encapsulated.

04:08.310 --> 04:13.740
Do you know when MAC addresses are used and when they are not used.

04:13.740 --> 04:19.400
Download the attached a packet trace a file and see if you can answer these questions yourself.

04:19.410 --> 04:25.410
Otherwise watch the next video we all show you the answers to these questions.
